# Paper Guava UI

This is a stylized component library of React components used in Victor Perez's projects. It has an emphasis on:

- Performance
- Accessibility
- Documentation

Because of this, there are various design tradoffs you may encounter. Most of them will be listed here in time as the format is more ironed out.

This is very much an early version and many things are a work in progress.
