# ImageLink

`ImageLink` is an anchor component used to display child elements overtop an image.

export const Template = (args) => <ImageLink {...args} />

<Canvas>
    <Story id="core-ui-image-link--main-story"/>
</Canvas>

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { ImageLink } from '@pguava-ui'

<ImageLink href="/writing" imgSrc="https://victorjperez.github.io/writing/assets/img/morgantown.jpg">
  <p>This Town</p>
</ImageLink>
```

## Component Options

<ArgsTable of={ImageLink} />

Below is a more detailed list of props for `ImageLink` and their usage.

### Image Brightness

You can set the Brightness of the image by filter by passing a `brightness` value.

```jsx
<ImageLink brightness="90%" />
```

### Image Source

The base of `ImageLink` is an `img` element, and needs a src passed via `imgSrc`. If no source is passed, it will fall back to light gray.
```jsx
<ImageLink imgSrc="https://victorjperez.github.io/writing/assets/img/morgantown.jpg" />
```

## Accessibility

Below are the built in accessibility notes and considerations for `Button`.

## Only use decorative images

Any `imgSrc` provided should be pruely decorative, and should not be critical to the usage of the component.

## Ensure text color contrast when using brightness

Depending on the passed children, your brightness value may not let text have enough color contrast to meet accessibility standards. Be sure to check this with every child component possible for `ImageLink`.

## Provide aria label if child does not contain text

If you are not passing text to `ImageLink`, an `aria-label` should be provided to describe the link.
